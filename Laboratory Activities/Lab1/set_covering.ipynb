    "Some implementations of the A* search algorithm ideated and programmed by **Claudio Savelli (s)** & **Mattia Sabato (s305849)** during a cold and rainy October. We have designed two algorithms in order to not only reach the goal in the **fastest way** but also in a **smart way**. We achieve this by **reducing the number of overlappings** and by forcing a solution which has the **smallest number of shared points** in the sets considered in the final solution. Even if slower, our solutions show better performances than the one proposed by the Professor when setting the number of overlappings as a major KPI."

    "Here we describe the two algorithms we have introduced to solve the set covering problem when minimizing the number of overlappings. Even though not perfect, we had a lot of fun while designing them and we hope to improve them further in the near future!\n",

    "- **A\\* with proximity**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    We use as a heuristic the **closeness** between the goal and the candidate state by **summing up** the number of **marginal** points covered by the last. Intuitively, it will be picked the state which will help the most to get close to the final configuration. As a cost, we **sum up** the **point-wise overlappings** over all the sets and them we sum them to obtain a single value which measures how bad is the new state in terms of sovrappositions of tiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **A\\* with cosine similarity**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    In this case we use as our heuristic the **cosine similarity** between the candidate state and the goal. Since we can think at each state as a vector in the space, the cosine similarity will increase when two vectors share a **similar direction**, which is a proxy for the state they are characterized by. In a certain sense, we aim to take a sequence of sets that, when summed, **move the resulting vector toward the goal**. As a cost, we use the **norm** of the resulting vector; the intuition is that when there are many overlappings, of course the norm will increase (even though the direction stays the same)."

Our algorithms may benefit a lot from some fort of further optimization, but due to lack of time we were not able to implement it. Still, given our goal, the results is **more than satisfactory**! We actually were able to **minimize the overlappings** and streak a **good balance** with the number of tiles needed. Given the premises and the requirements, it is a success!
