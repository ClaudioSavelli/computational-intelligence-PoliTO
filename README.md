|                *Lab 1*                |             Implementation of the A* search  algorithm for the set covering problem. New heuristics proposed (Proximity and Cos Similarity) and cost functions             | [Mattia Sabato](https://github.com/Mattizza) |                    [Folder](https://github.com/ClaudioSavelli/computational-intelligence-PoliTO/tree/main/Laboratory%20Activities/Lab1)                   |
| *Lab 1 - Post  Deadline Improvements* |                           Various improvements of Lab 1, carried out after the deadline.  Added visualisation of experimental results and graphs.                          | [Mattia Sabato](https://github.com/Mattizza) | [Folder](https://github.com/ClaudioSavelli/computational-intelligence-PoliTO/tree/main/Laboratory%20Activities/Lab1%20-%20post%20deadline%20improvements) |
|         *Halloween Challange*         | Took part in the Halloween Challenge. New  algorithm for the set covering the problem proposed based on Hierarchical Clustering,  the Manhattan Distance and Smart Pruning | [Mattia Sabato](https://github.com/Mattizza) |             [Folder]( https://github.com/ClaudioSavelli/computational-intelligence-PoliTO/tree/main/Other%20Activities/Halloween%20Challange)             |
|        *In class Presentation*        |                       Presented, during the lecture of 02/11/2023,  the results of the Halloween challenge and  the explanation of the method used.                        | [Mattia Sabato](https://github.com/Mattizza) |              [Folder](https://github.com/ClaudioSavelli/computational-intelligence-PoliTO/tree/main/Other%20Activities/Halloween%20Challange)             |

The strategies proposed by us and the professor were compared.                                                                                |                   [Luca Catalano](https://github.com/LucaCatalano13)                  |                                                                            [Folder](https://github.com/ClaudioSavelli/computational-intelligence-PoliTO/tree/main/Laboratory%20Activities/Lab2)                                                                           |
